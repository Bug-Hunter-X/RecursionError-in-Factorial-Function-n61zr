# RecursionError in Factorial Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in Python's recursive functions: infinite recursion due to improper base case handling.

The `bug.py` file contains a factorial function that works correctly for non-negative integers but throws a `RecursionError` for negative inputs.

The `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version of the factorial function that handles negative inputs gracefully.
